# BreastCancerDetection_UsingDeepLearnin
## Written By: Payal Chatterjee

Breast cancer is the second most prevalent malignancy among Indian women, and it is on the rise in the country.   Invasive Ductal Carcinoma is one of the most common forms of Breast Cancer and about 80% of all breast cancers are Invasive Ductal Carcinomas. Breast Cancer subtype identification and analysis is a crucial clinical task, and proper algorithmic methods can potentially save time and reduce error.   Through the development of automatic image processing tools, digitizing pathology is a current trend that delivers vast amounts of visual data, enabling for a faster and more accurate diagnosis.   This program presents a novel approach for the detection and visual examination of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) from unlabeled Histopathology Images using Deep Learning (DL) which is a representation learning method that is well-suited to image analysis problems in digital pathology. The dataset of the Histopathology images comprises of 277,524 50x50 pixel RGB digital picture patches, all of which were obtained from 162 H&E-stained breast histopathology samples.  These images are tiny patches that were taken from images of breast tissue samples.
